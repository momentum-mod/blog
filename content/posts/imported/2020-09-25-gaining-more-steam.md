    Momentum Mod now has an official Steam store page! It’s feeling more and more official by the month, and this is
    definitely a major step to take on our path to v1.0.0. Feel free to check it out, add the game to your
    wishlist, and share it with your friends and family!

    We will stay in a “coming soon” state until v1.0.0 drops, which we estimate will be in around a year, at worst 18
    months. Keep in mind that this project is all volunteer-passion-based, and goes as fast as free time for everyone
    involved will allow. It could come faster, or take longer than 18 months to drop. We will keep everyone up to date
    as much as we can on our progress, though!

Also keep in mind that our progress has been mapped out in roadmap form via <a href="https://github.com/orgs/momentum-mod/projects">our GitHub organization projects page</a>. If you feel like you can help out, be sure to join <a href="https://discord.gg/n4v52uv">our Discord server</a> and don’t be afraid to reach out! We have plenty of things that need done, and there’s a key involved for those dedicated to helping us out.
