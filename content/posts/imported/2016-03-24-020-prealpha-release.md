<p>Just a quick update, we released a new version, 0.2.0 prealpha, which you can try for yourself <a href="https://github.com/momentum-mod/game/releases/tag/0.2.0-prealpha">here</a>. Instructions for installing the mod are on the docs section of the main website, which you can find <a href="http://momentum-mod.org/docs/installing">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The changes include full support for scroll gamemodes, including the stamina system from CS:S. Currently, the “legit” scroll/stamina gamemode is automatically applied if a map with the kz_ prefix is loaded. In the future, you will be able to select the gamemode from the map selector screen.</p><p>That’s all for now, stay tuned for more updates!</p><p>-Momentum Mod Team</p>
