<p>
Hello all, it’s been almost two months since 0.8.0 dropped, and as mentioned in that version’s changelog, we’ll be updating the game (a bit) more frequently now that a large chunk of groundwork was completed.
</p>
<p>
But first...
</p>

<h2>A Few Notes</h2>

<ul><li>We are resetting the leaderboards with each of these updates, up until we are comfortable with the systems in place enough to not warrant it. The leaderboards will also be wiped clean right before the public Beta (1.0.0), and hopefully never again after that. They were wiped in this version due to potential exploits found in 0.8.0, and will be wiped in 0.8.2 as we are refactoring the replay file format.<br></li><li>We appreciate the hype towards the game, and as a friendly reminder, the game is in private Alpha until the public Beta at 1.0.0, and requires a key to playtest. Simply wanting to just play is great, but not what we need right now. Keys are currently reserved for those looking to help the development of the game, to enable us to have the best 1.0.0 we can have. This includes, but is not limited to: developers, mappers, seasoned surf/bhop veterans, and of course some fresh eyes (newbs) to the genre as well. We’ve generated and given out over 400 keys but have only had at most 200 active playtesters, so we are being more careful about which keys are being given to whom. We want everyone to play, but at 1.0.0. Thank you all again for patiently waiting for this.<br></li><li>The website (<a href="https://momentum-mod.org">https://momentum-mod.org</a>) is only for playtesters to be able to fully use. While we were stoked to see <strong>over 2000 people signed up (!!!)</strong>, the website is a companion to the most recent versions of the game, and functionally does little for those without access to the latest version. That being said, are you a web designer or programmer? We would love any help getting the website along faster (this means getting a key)! We currently only have two developers working on the website and would love any help we can get on it.
</li>
</ul><p>
Alright, with those in mind, let’s get to the actual changelog.
</p>
<h2>Game Changes</h2>


<h3>Added</h3>


<ul><li>Discord rich presence for Linux and Mac (thanks<a href="https://github.com/kitlith"> @kitlith</a> !)

</ul><h2>Momentum Map List Update</h2>


<p>
For this version, we are going to see if the Surf-implemented systems apply well enough to the Bhop game type. And thus, with this update, we have added 10 bhop maps as an initial test of them:
</p>
<ul><li>bhop_aimers_hell

</li><li>bhop_arcane

</li><li>bhop_dipl

</li><li>bhop_eazy

</li><li>bhop_jago

</li><li>bhop_monority

</li><li>bhop_monotonous

</li><li>bhop_muchfast

</li><li>bhop_pharma

</li><li>bhop_sqee
</li>
</ul><p>
On top of those maps, we have also added 5 more surf maps for users to try out and find bugs on:
</p>
<ul><li>surf_beginner

</li><li>surf_milkyway

</li><li>surf_mom

</li><li>surf_pantheon

</li><li>surf_rookie
</li>
</ul><h2>Community Compilation 2</h2>


<p>
The second Momentum Mod community compilation, organized by OOSII, has been released as well! You can watch it here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6DK1eLfiU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6DK1eLfiU</a>

Thank you to all that participated in it!
</p>
<h2>Until Next Time</h2>


<p>
With a somewhat more organized development process, we’re aiming to have 0.8.2 out relatively soon too, which will contain more fixes and features requested by you! Please <a href="https://discord.gg/V4gS7Qg">join our Discord community</a> if you have not already to keep the most up-to-date with the development of the game.
