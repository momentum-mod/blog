<h3><strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Another year, another update!</span></em></strong></h3>

<p>
Hello all, it&rsquo;s that time again for another <em>momentous</em> occasion! It&rsquo;s been over a year and (almost) two months since the last released update, 0.7.2. A lot <a href="https://blog.momentum-mod.org/post/179459425599/not-a-game-update-update">has happened</a> since then, so I am extremely pleased to finally be able to talk about the next step for Momentum.
</p>
<p>
0.8.0 is a major milestone for Momentum Mod as it lays all of the groundwork for the future of the game. The game now has working leaderboards, XP systems, map selection with pre-zoned maps, and many, <em>many</em> more features, quality-of-life improvements, and bug fixes that I&rsquo;ll cover in a bit!
</p>
<p>
And before we jump in to the main changelog, I&rsquo;d like to thank everyone with their patience towards the game. Development slows down to a crawl sometimes, but the game is still going strong!
</p>
<p>
So, without further ado:

</p><h3><strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Mr. World Wide Web</span></em></strong></h3>

<p>
Momentum Mod has a completely revamped website, written from the ground-up to support the features we need. It has a map selector, leaderboards display, rudimentary stats, profiles, and much more!
</p>
<p>
Check it out here: <strong><em><a href="https://momentum-mod.org">https://momentum-mod.org</a></em></strong> !
</p>
<p>
Everything on the site is going to be improved alongside the game. Just keep in mind: everything is subject to change, including layouts! If stuff is missing, we most likely know, but feel free to suggest any changes as well!
</p>
<p>
If you&rsquo;re experienced with web design or website programming, we could always use more help with it. Please reach out to Gocnak about helping out!
</p>
<p>
</p><h3><strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tracks, Zones, and Triggers, Oh My!</span></em></strong></h3>

<p>
0.8.0 sees a major overhaul to the zoning system found in the game. We now use a Track-&gt;Zone-&gt;Trigger system for maps. This system has a couple extra steps to it from the old zone tools, so let me break down the terminology:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tracks:</strong> Tracks are entire courses through a map. <strong>Track 0 is</strong> considered <strong>the </strong>default or <strong>&ldquo;main&rdquo; track</strong>, whereas <strong>tracks 1 to 63 are the &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; tracks</strong> for a map.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Zones:</strong> Zones split up tracks into different areas, and denote where the player is on the track. The <strong>end </strong>zone, reserving zone number 0, denotes the end of the track. The <strong>start </strong>zone, reserving zone number 1, specifies the start of the track. <strong>Tracks need to have both a start <em>and </em>end zone to be valid!</strong> Optionally, though recommended for lengthy maps, the <strong>stage </strong>and <strong>checkpoint </strong>zones can be used to denote player progress throughout the map. <strong>These start at zone number 2</strong> and go up to 63. <strong>Stages </strong>are used when the map usually has clear-cut sections that typically don&rsquo;t flow together, and failing them starts at a specified point (the stage start). <strong>Checkpoints </strong>are used to denote player progress on <strong><em>purely linear maps</em></strong>, where resetting/failing places the player back at the start of the map.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Triggers:</strong> Invisible geometries that serve as the contact points for zones. <strong>Zones can have multiple triggers, up to 63 if needed.</strong> This allows maps to have multiple end zones and start zones, allowing some freedom for symmetrical designs.
</p>
<p>
So now that you (hopefully) understand the system, you may be wondering: how does one go about making the zones for maps? Well, enter our (sorta) new zoning tools:

<p>
The box builder is a simple rectangular volume builder for easy rectangular platform zones. It&rsquo;s the same as before, but now paired with the new Zone Menu UI, you can customize your simple zones even further. But that&rsquo;s not all...

<p>
Thanks to Mehis, we are now able to support any shape prism you could think of. This includes concave shapes as well!
</p>
<p>
</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1080" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/409531321455607808/575071044247748623/hl2_2019-05-06_09-50-29.png"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/b6829dee06487254647753b6265151c3/a151810267cdd0c7-03/s540x810/9d980ae4a7d0b30428bcb9a1a658a73b505c5d81.png" width="" alt="alt_text" title="Zone Shapes" data-orig-height="1080" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/409531321455607808/575071044247748623/hl2_2019-05-06_09-50-29.png"></figure><p>
The zones are outlined by default, but every single one of them can be customized with the commands:
</p>
<p>
mom_zone_[start/checkpoint/stage/end]_outline_[enable/color]
</p>
<p>
</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="598" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/f7hB2aT.png"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/46ea77ef02b6324cc55122750f89547f/a151810267cdd0c7-fe/s540x810/eba730743e7f329df88b7c8dbe060f6e958ea9ba.png" width="" alt="alt_text" title="Zone Outlines" data-orig-height="598" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/f7hB2aT.png"></figure><p>
<strong><em>What all of this means:</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Maps should not have zones embedded in them anymore!</em></strong> The map uploading process takes in a separate .zon file and stores the zones on the website, so any updates to the zones while the map is in testing can be done without having to re-download the entire map. We will eventually update our VBSP to parse these zones and their geometries and spit out a proper .zon file with all the correct settings, but for now, just use the in-game tools!
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Bonuses can have stages/checkpoints! </em></strong>Maps can have up to 64 total tracks (1 main track and 63 bonuses), each track can have 64 total zones (1 start + 1 end + 62 stages/checkpoints), and each zone can have up to 64 triggers. We hope this flexibility allows for some creative zoning layouts and eases the pain found in the old zoning tools.
</p>
<p>
</p><h3><strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Maps Make The World Go &lsquo;Round</span></em></strong></h3>

<p>
What&rsquo;s Momentum Mod without the pre-zoned maps to play it? A good surf/bhop mapping testing tool, I guess... Anyways, this update sees some major overhauling work done to the Map Selector and relevant UIs.
</p>
<p>
</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="762" data-orig-width="1507" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/Kd96XEu.png"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/a3c361c6a1355b4cb8e9031230411761/a151810267cdd0c7-69/s540x810/62595f52a6ef1672e67fd68b5bc0002b259ba30d.png" width="" alt="alt_text" title="Map Selector Dialog" data-orig-height="762" data-orig-width="1507" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/Kd96XEu.png"></figure><p>
The main UI was overhauled to show the three main tabs of interest (for 0.8.0; we&rsquo;ll add more in the future): Browse (for browsing maps), Favorites (for favorite maps), and Library. Maps in your Library are maps that you would like to play, and are downloaded to your computer. You have to add maps to your library in order to be able to play them, but it also serves as a good indicator of how many people like the map enough to want to be able to play it. Removing a map from your library will also delete the map from your computer, to help save that precious hard drive space.
</p>
<p>
</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="799" data-orig-width="560" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/vb7FbRg.png"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/8142bb6f0050b887d3c8cd2dd8af7dc8/a151810267cdd0c7-f1/s540x810/f9cd6c1409ee034cbecd93e6d4bacb2c08a935d7.png" width="" alt="alt_text" title="Map Info Dialog" data-orig-height="799" data-orig-width="560" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/vb7FbRg.png"></figure><p>
The Map Info dialog also got a major face lift, using a design by Juxtapo. At a quick glance you can see the map&rsquo;s info, and even a mini leaderboards for the default map category! 
</p>
<p>
    </p><div style="position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)"><iframe src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/DirectPaltryArcticfox" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>

<p>
The Map Info dialog also features a brand new, all-VGUI control called ImageGallery, which allows you to peruse the map&rsquo;s images to get a good idea of how the map looks like before downloading it!
</p>
<p>
With the Map Selector comes some fun commands to configure how the map selector works:
</p>
<ul><li>mom_map_delete_queue [0,1] when 1, queues deleting maps removed from library to when the game shuts down

</li><li>mom_map_download_auto [0,1] when 1, automatically downloads maps when added to library

</li><li>mom_map_download_queue [0,1] when 1, queues map to be downloaded, using a defined parallel count

</li><li>mom_map_download_queue_parallel [1,20] specifies how many maps can download at once in the queue

</li><li>mom_map_download_cancel_confirm [0,1] when 1, opens a confirmation box when trying to cancel a download
</li>
</ul><p>
All map data is cached inside of the new &ldquo;map_cache.dat&rdquo; file found in your momentum folder. If there&rsquo;s ever any issues with the map lists, just delete this file and restart your game!
</p>
<p>
With the new track-zone-trigger system, and this fancy map selector, we&rsquo;ve created 10 zoned surf maps to test the systems in place for 0.8.0:<br></p>
<ul><li>surf_666

</li><li>surf_ace

</li><li>surf_kitsune

</li><li>surf_lt_omnific

</li><li>surf_mdrn

</li><li>surf_me

</li><li>surf_mesa

</li><li>surf_overgrowth

</li><li>surf_saturday

</li><li>surf_stonework3
</li>
</ul><p>
All of these maps support Leaderboards and Rank/Cosmetic XP via the website. Speaking of those...
</p>
<p>
</p><h3><strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Leaderboards? I barely even know her boards</span></em></strong></h3>

<p>
Momentum Mod 0.8.0 also features the first iteration of the global leaderboards and XP systems. Let&rsquo;s start with XP.
</p>
<p>
There are two XP systems in place for Momentum Mod: Rank and Cosmetic XP.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rank XP: </strong>Commonly referred to as &ldquo;rank points&rdquo; from servers, this is only rewarded when you achieve a Personal Best (PB) run on a map. Rank XP is determined by three categories, and you can read more about the calculation <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zj8FKrfAMqYSnAHjySJqoqq0vmAEWxYXVcYLi3_u7NA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zj8FKrfAMqYSnAHjySJqoqq0vmAEWxYXVcYLi3_u7NA/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zj8FKrfAMqYSnAHjySJqoqq0vmAEWxYXVcYLi3_u7NA/edit</a>) In short, as long as you&rsquo;re submitting a run above the rank 50000, you will get Rank XP. How much you get depends on where you place. You can use Rank XP as a way to determine how <strong>good</strong> someone is at playing Momentum.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cosmetic XP: </strong>Cosmetic XP, on the other hand, aims to fill the gaps that Rank XP creates. Cosmetic XP is gained from submitting runs (PB or not), completing challenges, earning achievements, racing other players, and so on. You can see the Cosmetic XP details used in 0.8.0 <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JiHJYsxlGPXAZqCPh7-paJI6U_TH-Ro0H0OWDFCiA74/">here</a>. (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JiHJYsxlGPXAZqCPh7-paJI6U_TH-Ro0H0OWDFCiA74/">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JiHJYsxlGPXAZqCPh7-paJI6U_TH-Ro0H0OWDFCiA74/</a>) Cosmetic XP is designed to be grindable, but has no effect on anything other than your level shown on your profile. You can use Cosmetic XP/Levels as a way to determine how <strong>much</strong> someone has played Momentum.
</p>
<p>
With these two XP systems in place, we hope that the leaderboards become a fun challenge to improve in, rewarding every attempt along the way. But that being said, we will be iterating upon the values used in both systems, and clearing times all along the way. <strong>Every time set in 0.8.0&rsquo;s leaderboards, all the way up to 1.0.0, will be removed by 1.0.0.</strong> 1.0.0 will launch with a clean slate and hopefully thoroughly tested and agreeable XP systems in place.
</p>
<p>
On a similar note, <strong>with 0.8.0, the only runs we are accepting are the main track, and specifically doing all of the zones for it.</strong> <strong>We will be adding Bonuses and ILs with 0.9.0!</strong>
</p>

All of the CS:S weapons have gotten a facelift as well, thanks to Cabbage McGravel on the team. The LMG, shotgun, sniper, SMG, and knife have a custom model and design to them, to further distance the reliance from mounting CS:S to play the game.
</p>
<p>
</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="471" data-orig-width="347" data-orig-src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/409531321455607808/459066378620633101/New_Wep_Icons.png"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/0d300ffd2171bc01262355298c3383cf/a151810267cdd0c7-5a/s540x810/8027417297abd6278df9909a0971e1c7b90e65d6.png" width="" alt="alt_text" title="New Weapon Icons" data-orig-height="471" data-orig-width="347" data-orig-src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/409531321455607808/459066378620633101/New_Wep_Icons.png"></figure><p>
On a similar note, the icons for the weapons have been updated, along with the tokens used in the HUD, as to not have any #Unlocalized_Tokens_Show_Up everywhere.
</p>
<p>
</p><h3><strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">All The&hellip; Small Things</span></em></strong></h3>

<p>
<strong>Discord Rich Presence</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="339" data-orig-width="311" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/GCJJ5dD.png"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/2a332473cd6f8113010e00fa572398dc/a151810267cdd0c7-19/s540x810/d4a54cd405b7bd2a914c7d41042480c83b633bd5.png" width="" alt="alt_text" title="Discord Rich Presence" data-orig-height="339" data-orig-width="311" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/GCJJ5dD.png"></figure><p>
For the Windows build only, we have added Discord Rich Presence so that you can show off important gaming statistics <del>like just how long you&rsquo;re <em>really</em> taking to beat surf_mesa</del>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Checkpoint Menu Checks Out</strong>
</p>
<p>
The &ldquo;Checkpoint&rdquo; menu has changed its name to &ldquo;Saveloc&rdquo; menu, to help clear the distinction (&ldquo;checkpoint&rdquo;s are reserved for linear map zones now). All the saveloc related commands are now under the <strong>mom_saveloc_ </strong>prefix, so make sure to fix up your custom binds!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Timer Sounds</strong>
</p>
<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/38yg2/jagbpm" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"></iframe></div>
<p>
The timer features some new sounds from Monolith, so you can have complimentary sounds to several timer-related actions, such as starting the timer, resetting the timer, when the timer fails to start, as well as completing a run that&rsquo;s either a PB or WR! 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Map-Based Autoexecs</strong>
</p>
<p>
We&rsquo;ve added in map-specific auto-executed commands (ran every time you load the map). This helps with running specific commands when the map starts up, if need be.
</p>
<ul><li>Use mom_mapcfg_add (command) to add a convar/concommand to execute upon map load

</li><li>Use mom_mapcfg_clear to remove the map's saved commands/convars

</li><li>Use mom_mapcfg_print to see all the map's current saved commands
</li>
</ul><p>
<strong>New Triggers/Entities</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="193" data-orig-width="1787" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/gXOC8gs.png"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/302d8a4ce64b001ad6f4462539b28b88/a151810267cdd0c7-14/s540x810/b6e400c141d698effd858c634e992d0dce1b781d.png" width="" alt="alt_text" title="Cabbage Goodness" data-orig-height="193" data-orig-width="1787" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/gXOC8gs.png"></figure><p>
From Cabbage McGravel, we have added custom trigger textures for various triggers for use in Hammer, to help distinguish between which triggers are which! These are just visual helper textures and must be set manually.
</p>
<p>
On top of that, we&rsquo;ve added three convenience entities:
</p>
<ul><li><strong>trigger_momentum_reversespeed</strong> 
<ul><li>Reverses the speed of the player upon touching it
</li> 
</ul></li><li><strong>trigger_momentum_setspeed</strong> 
<ul><li>Sets the speed of the player to a fixed value and angle upon touch (prevents boost spamming) 
</li> 
</ul></li><li><strong>trigger_momentum_speedthreshold</strong> 
<ul><li>A trigger that fires an event if the player is going over or under a certain speed threshold
</li> 
</ul></li> 
</ul><p>
We&rsquo;ve also improved some of the existing ones:
</p>
<ul><li>Added outputs for trigger_momentum_onehop/multihop

</li><li>Added WASD blocking to trigger_momentum_limitmovement

</li><li>All Momentum triggers force the Clients spawnflag on now
</li>
</ul><p>
</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="500" data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/426246149620367370/575087650067709955/improved.png"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/a15f646f60c008dcebe80b77d30226c1/a151810267cdd0c7-41/s540x810/b839d28d31c3836dc5ef54e8fa584fedac6052d6.png" width="" alt="alt_text" title="What's Improved" data-orig-height="500" data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/426246149620367370/575087650067709955/improved.png"></figure><p>
Lots of things were improved upon between 0.7.2 and 0.8.0. I&rsquo;ll tackle this by just&hellip; giving you the entire list. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll also bold the important ones to help.
</p>
<p>
</p><h3><strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Gameplay Improvements Galore</span></em></strong></h3>

<ul><li>m_rawinput now defaults to 1

</li><li><strong>Add null bind support (mom_enable_overlapping_keys)</strong>
<p>

        *We decided to just allow nulls in Momentum due to the detection for them potentially causing innocent people to get banned.
</p>

</li><li><strong>Add "release forward key on jump" setting (mom_release_forward_on_jump)</strong>

</li><li>Removed default vertical movement in noclip -- use +moveup and +movedown

</li><li><strong>sv_tickrate is now sv_interval_per_tick for further clarity (1 / desired tickrate)</strong>

</li><li><strong>Refactored all hud convars/concommands to be under the namespace &ldquo;mom_hud_&rdquo;</strong>

</li><li>Replay files have a new name, home folder, and a slightly updated format (old ones need not apply)

</li><li>Added disabled buttons to ghosts as well, only exception is the BHOP blocking

</li><li>Show in_strafe on the keypress display

</li><li><strong>Allow sv_cheats 1 to still save your replay, but not submit it</strong>

</li><li><strong>Put most commands of interest (Zone tools, ent_create, ent_teleport, set_[pos/ang], etc) behind requiring launching the game with -mapping, which does not submit runs by default [<a href="https://i.imgur.com/JvfwCbY.png">Image of enabling this</a>]</strong>

</li><li>Add mom_timer_stop (default bound to the B key) which allows you to manually stop your run

</li><li>Whitelisted some common commands for point_[server/client]command and defaulted the sv_allow_point_command to the whitelist
</li>

</ul><p>
</p><h3><strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">UI/UX Improvements Galore</span></em></strong></h3>

<ul><li><strong>Added turnbind direction into the keypress display [<a href="https://i.imgur.com/N1Ew2aF.png">Image</a>]</strong>

</li><li>New ICO to match the new logo of the game [<a href="https://i.imgur.com/aIQFoft.png">Image</a>]

</li><li>TextEntry Improvements:<br>

</p><h4><strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">More Maps</span></em></strong></h4>

<p>
We will be adding more and more maps with each incremental update to the game!
</p>
<p>
</p><h4><strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">More Game Types</span></em></strong></h4>

<p>
Bhop and KZ are planned to be supported before 1.0.0 drops!
</p>
<p>
</p><h4><strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">More Bugs</span></em></strong></h4>

<p>
Just kidding! ...Hopefully! Well&hellip;
</p>
<p>
</p><h4><strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Achievement Unlocked: Helped Make Achievements</span></em></strong></h4>

<p>
...but we&rsquo;re after some more and would like your ideas on more of them! Check out our achievement submission form here: <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/C2ZIteN4n1NmMQXg2">https://goo.gl/forms/C2ZIteN4n1NmMQXg2</a> 
</p>
<p>
If you&rsquo;re looking for ideas we&rsquo;ve already taken into consideration, you can find them on the spreadsheet here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19c0fHHFdwIK9VyMMx94L-f3UN1I3hMpD8mM56nuP9v0/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19c0fHHFdwIK9VyMMx94L-f3UN1I3hMpD8mM56nuP9v0</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><h4><strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Another year, another update?</span></em></strong></h4>

<p>
Although 0.8.0 took a monumentally long time to come out, it did set the groundwork for most of the things left for 1.0.0. You can expect more frequent, minor updates to the game, alongside a much faster development turnaround now that the core features have their groundwork laid out under them. It&rsquo;s easier to iterate on a design than it is to design it from the ground-up.
</p>
<p>
I have stopped giving out predictions for versions because it&rsquo;s just hard to properly estimate how long this volunteer-based passion project takes sometimes. But I can assure you that 0.8.1, 0.8.2, 0.9.0, etc are all going to come <em>much</em> sooner than 0.7.2 -&gt; 0.8.0 took.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, please feel free to join our Discord server (<a href="https://discord.gg/wQWkRb6">https://discord.gg/wQWkRb6</a>) and hang out while we update the game!
